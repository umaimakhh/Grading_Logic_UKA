# Grading_Logic_UKA
Consider the grading logic for this class:
• If the assignment is not submitted as a single uncompressed .py file, the grade is 0.
• If the assignment does not include the author’s name and date, the grade is 0.
• If the assignment does not include the honor statement, “I have not given or received any
unauthorized assistance on this assignment”, the grade is 0
• If the assignment does not include a link to an unlisted 3-minute YouTube video presenting the
code and answering the assigned questions, the grade is 0.
• If the assignment satisfies all of the above conditions…
o Up to ten points are awarded based on the correctness of the code; that is, how well it
meets the given specifications.
o Up to ten points are awarded based on the elegance of the code (data structure selection,
algorithm efficiency, function implementation, etc.).
o Up to ten points are awarded based on the code hygiene (white space, docstrings, etc.).
o Up to ten points are awarded based on the quality of the discussion in the YouTube video.
• Late assignments lose 1% (of total possible) per hour.
Write a python function which asks the user a series of questions based on the above logic. For example,
“Did the student include their name?” or “Out of ten points, how would you evaluate the correctness of
the code?”
Notice that if the student did not include their name, there is no reason to ask any more questions.
Likewise, if the assignment was not late, there is no reason to ask how late it was.
The function should return the student’s total score
